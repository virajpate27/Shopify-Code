- Metafields and metaobjects help us to store and display custom information on products, collections, customers, orders, and more.

1) Metafields (like custom fields)
â€” they allow you to store extra information about standard Shopify resources (like products, variants, collections, orders, etc.).

Example Use Cases:
- Add a "Material" field to products.
- Store "Care Instructions" for clothing.
- Add a custom size chart URL for each product.

{{ product.metafields.details.fabric }}


2) Metaobjects (like custom Dynamic fields)
 - Metaobjects are custom content types you define yourself. 
 - They are more structured and reusable than regular metafields.

Example Use Cases:
 - Define a Model metaobject for different phone models.
 - Create a Lookbook metaobject to use in multiple products.
 - Build a FAQ metaobject for your product pages.
