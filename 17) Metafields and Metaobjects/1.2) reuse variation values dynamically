✅ Step-by-Step Guide

1. Create a Metaobject Definition
 - Go to Shopify Admin > Content > Metaobjects.
 - Click "Create definition".
 - Give it a name like Phone Models.
 - Add fields like:
    - Title (type: Single line text)
    - Optionally, a Slug or Handle for reference.


2. Add Entries to Your Metaobject
- Go back to Metaobjects > Phone Models.
- Click "Add entry".
- Add all models:
 - iPhone 16
 - iPhone 16 Plus
 - iPhone 15
 - iPhone 15 Plus

 3. Link Metaobjects to Your Products
 - In your Product Metaobject definition, create a field called Model (type: Metaobject reference, referencing the Phone Models definition).
 - You can enable "List of values" if you want to allow multiple models per product.

 4. Use It Dynamically
 - Now, when creating or editing a product or another metaobject that includes the Model field, you can select from the already-created models.
 - You don’t have to recreate or retype model names.
