- Blocks allow you to create modular, repeatable content inside a section.
- Think of them like "mini-sections" that users can add, remove, and reorder in the theme editor.

ðŸ”¸ Example Use Case:
Letâ€™s say you're building a "Features Section" where the store owner can add multiple feature items (icon + title + description). Thatâ€™s where blocks shine.


NOTE : Example added in New File.

ðŸ§  Explanation:

2. "name": "Features"
This is the name that will appear in the Shopify theme editor for the section.

3. "settings": []
This is where you define global settings for the section (e.g., background color, layout options). In this example, it's empty.

4. "blocks": []
This array defines the repeatable block type(s) the section supports. You can define multiple block types.

- This block has:
"type": "feature_item" â†’ Internal name for the block.

"name": "Feature Item" â†’ Display name in the theme editor.

"settings": [] â†’ Settings specific to each block.

- Block Settings:

- Setting Type	Purpose
  image_picker	-> Let the user pick an icon/image.
  text	        -> Title of the feature.
  textarea	    -> Description text.

5. "max_blocks": 6
Limits the number of feature items that can be added to 6. You can change this if needed.

6. "presets": []
This provides a default layout for the section. It will be auto-added when you click "Add section" in the theme editor.


ðŸ§± HTML Output Section:
<div class="features-section">
  {% for block in section.blocks %}
    <div class="feature-item">
      {% if block.settings.icon %}
        <img src="{{ block.settings.icon | image_url }}" alt="">
      {% endif %}
      <h3>{{ block.settings.title }}</h3>
      <p>{{ block.settings.description }}</p>
    </div>
  {% endfor %}
</div>

âœ… What This Does:
   - Loops through each block added by the store admin.
   - For each block:
     :- Shows the image (icon), Displays the title, Shows the description
